# Genetic Algorithm for Portfolio Selection in C++

## 1 Introduction
This project endeavors to harness the power of genetic algorithms for the purpose of financial portfolio construction, specifically honing in on the optimization of the Sharpe ratio. The diverse set of financial assets under consideration includes Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Tesla (TSLA), NIO Inc. (NIO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), oFi Tecnologie (SOFI), Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Intel Corporation (INTC), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Ford Motor Company (F), Pfizer_Inc. (PFE), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), and AT&T Inc. (T). The focal point of the optimization is to achieve portfolios that not only maximize returns but also minimize volatility, aligning with the principles of modern portfolio theory. The Sharpe ratio, a pivotal metric quantifying risk-adjusted returns, serves as the guiding light for evaluating and refining portfolio performance. This report provides a detailed account of the implementation of this portfolio optimization using a genetic algorithm, predominantly leveraging C++ with supplementary support from Python.
